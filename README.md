# voice.ai Maker
Automatically makes a voice for voice.ai built in Python.

## Requirements:
1. `pip install requirements.txt`
2. YouTube URL
3. There is no step 3

### Some things to know:
1. You **cannot** use the same name twice for the output files. For example, if you name the output file "lilyvtube", you **cannot** use "lilyvtube" again, otherwise file conflicts will happen. **However**, you can put any other character either in front, in between, or at the end of the name (for example, "lilyvtube2" or "6lilyvtube", etc) and everything will work fine.
2. You **will** have to run the script again for multiple videos/audio.
